    q: "What is a design review tool?",

  },
  {
    q: "Is this tool free?",
    a: "Yes. Guest review links are completely free. You can generate as many links as you need. Free links expire after 7 days. Create a free account to keep your projects permanently and manage all reviews in one dashboard.",

    a: "You can upload PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG and other image formats, PDF files, and video files up to 20 MB. For larger files or entire design systems, create a free account to unlock higher limits.",
